# MixedVolume-SparseResultant
Software for computing Mixed Volume (via mixed subdivisions) and Sparse Resultant matrices
Software packages developed in the 1990's and 2000's, practically not maintained after 2010

mixvol2020.tgz is a tarfile of the sources and executables for computing Mixed volume and Mixed cells via randomized mixed subidivions (by linear or affine liftings) on Linux. The Lift-Prune algorithm is due to Canny and Emiris (JSC article) and has been the most practical approach. The library also computes Stable Volume (see paper by Emiris and Verschelde).
